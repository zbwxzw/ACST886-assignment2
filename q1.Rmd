### question 1

#### part(a)

Calculate initial exposed to risk.
Life G and life J died during their insuring age 30, so $d_30$ is 2
Life B died before age 30 and the withdrawal date of life F is at age 30.

```{r}
d30<-2
E30<-8
q30<-d30/E30
q30
```


#### part(b)

Calculate central exposed to risk to obtain $\mu_30$, then obtain $q_30$
Life G and life J died during their insuring age 30.

```{r}
library("lubridate")

PA30_G<-"1995-10-29"
PA30_J<-"1996-03-06"
PA30<-c(PA30_G,PA30_J)

deathdate_G<-"1996-04-21"
deathdate_J<-"1997-02-17"
deathdate<-c(deathdate_G,deathdate_J)

c<-(time_length(difftime(deathdate,PA30),"days"))
c/365.25

d30<-2
E30_c<-1+0+1+1+1+0+0.4791+1+1+0.9528
mu30<-d30/E30_c
mu30
q30<-1-exp(-mu30)
q30
```
